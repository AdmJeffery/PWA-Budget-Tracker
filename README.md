![Tracker](./public/screenshots/Tracker.png)

## Description
Welcome to my PWA Budget Tracker. The purpose of this application is to allow the user the opportunity to track expenses both online and off. If done offline, the application stores form inputs into a database and then automatically incorporates them when back online.

## Instructions
This application is very simple. Simply enter the name of your expense at the top as well as the amount to be added/subtracted and then click either the "Add Funds" or "Subtract Funds" respectfully. Your entry will be added to the list below and be reflected in the graph.
